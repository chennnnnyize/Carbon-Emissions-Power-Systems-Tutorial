Electric power industry is the largest sector for energy-related CO2 emissions. To achieve a better understanding and future reduction of power-grid-level emissions, it is of growing importance to understand how such emissions are attributed to the power dispatch and consumption procedures. More importantly, standard grid operations such as economic dispatch and long-term planning tasks are not emission-centric, while the impacts and limits brought by emission objectives and constraints need to be explicitly considered and better understood. 

In this tutorial, based on the fundamentals of physical power flow and optimization of power systems, we will cover recent advancements in the following topics related to emission and power grids: i) Computation-efficient algorithms to trace back each load’s “generation mix” to each generator, so the locational average and marginal emission can be exactly modeled. ii) Emission-aware and emission-centric modeling, planning, and optimization techniques that integrate environmental objectives into traditional power system operations. iii) Frameworks for assessing the trade-offs between economic efficiency and emission reductions which can address the long-term planning objectives of carbon reduction and grid reliability.
